## âœ… Tips for a Great Contribution

- Follow the [JavaScript Standard Style][style] - linting issues will appear when you run `npm test`.  
- Keep PRs small and focused. If you have unrelated changes, submit them separately.  
- Write or update tests when possible.  
- Use meaningful commit messages. Example:  
  > âœ¨ Add calorie breakdown to meal analysis results  

Work-in-progress PRs are totally fine! Theyâ€™re great for getting feedback early.
