# SnapMealAI üçΩÔ∏è

**Empowering Smarter Food Choices with AI**

SnapMealAI helps users make informed, healthy meal decisions by analyzing food images and menus through AI.  
It provides instant ingredient recognition, calorie estimation, allergen alerts, and dietary suggestions, all in one snap!

---
## üöÄ Our Mission
Ordering food online is convenient, but users often don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in their meal, especially for visually complex or homemade dishes. Restaurants also struggle to communicate nutritional details quickly. **SnapMealAI** bridges this gap with AI-powered food understanding.

Ordering food online is convenient, but users often don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in their meal, especially for visually complex or homemade dishes. Restaurants also struggle to communicate nutritional details quickly.

**SnapMealAI** bridges this gap with AI-powered food understanding.

### üß† How It Works

1. Upload or take a photo of a meal or menu.
2. AI analyzes the image/text to identify ingredients.
3. SnapMealAI estimates calories, macros, and allergens.
4. It provides personalized recommendations, including healthier alternatives and portion suggestions.

### üí° Impact

- **Customers:** Make informed and healthier food choices.
- **Restaurants:** Provide nutrition transparency and build trust.
- **Delivery Platforms/Admins:** Differentiate with AI value-added insights.
- **Healthcare Partners:** Integrate AI-driven nutrition analysis with wellness platforms.

 ## üéØ Target Users
SnapMealAI is designed for:
- **Consumers** who want instant nutritional and allergen insights for meals and menus.
- **Restaurants** seeking to provide transparent nutrition information to customers.
- **Food delivery services** integrating AI-based meal analysis for added user value.
- **Healthcare & wellness partners** who want to monitor or recommend dietary habits through AI.

## üóìÔ∏è Development Roadmap

### **October ‚Äì Release 1: Prototype**

- Implement authentication flow with Signup, Login, and Home page.
- Build a frontend UI to upload a single food-item photo (either a photo of a menu item or an image downloaded online) and submit it for analysis.
- Integrate the GPT API to analyze the uploaded single-item image and return structured results: ingredients and details, nutrition summary, allergen warnings, healthier alternatives/suggestions, and a simple delivery recommendation.
- Build a frontend UI to display the analysis results (nutrition summary, ingredients & details, allergen warnings, healthier alternatives, and delivery recommendation).

### **November ‚Äì Release 2: Enhanced System**

- Add camera capture UI to allow users to take a real-time photo of a single menu item or food and submit it directly for analysis.
- Save image analysis results and build a history page where users can view, search, and re-open previously analyzed images.
- Allow users to specify allergy preferences in their profile and include them with analysis requests so the API can surface personalized allergen warnings.
- Build admin dashboard for managing user accounts.

## üß™ Example Use Cases
Here are some example scenarios demonstrating how SnapMealAI can be used:

- **Personal Health Tracking:** A user uploads a home-cooked meal photo to estimate calories and identify allergens.
- **Restaurant Menu Analysis:** A restaurant uses SnapMealAI to auto-generate nutrition labels for menu items.
- **Delivery Platform Integration:** An online food delivery app integrates SnapMealAI to help users choose healthier meals.

(Additional real-world case studies will be added after pilot testing.)
