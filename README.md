# SnapMealAI 🍽️

**Empowering Smarter Food Choices with AI**

SnapMealAI helps users make informed, healthy meal decisions by analyzing food images and menus through AI.  
It provides instant ingredient recognition, calorie estimation, allergen alerts, and dietary suggestions, all in one snap!

---

## 🚀 Our Mission

Ordering food online is convenient, but users often don’t know what’s in their meal, especially for visually complex or homemade dishes. Restaurants also struggle to communicate nutritional details quickly.

**SnapMealAI** bridges this gap with AI-powered food understanding.

### 🧠 How It Works
1. Upload or take a photo of a meal or menu.  
2. AI analyzes the image/text to identify ingredients.  
3. SnapMealAI estimates calories, macros, and allergens.  
4. It provides personalized recommendations, including healthier alternatives and portion suggestions.

### 💡 Impact
- **Customers:** Make informed and healthier food choices.  
- **Restaurants:** Provide nutrition transparency and build trust.  
- **Delivery Platforms/Admins:** Differentiate with AI value-added insights.  
- **Healthcare Partners:** Integrate AI-driven nutrition analysis with wellness platforms.
